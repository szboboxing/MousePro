# MousePro macOS Support

MousePro includes experimental macOS support alongside its primary Windows application. This document covers macOS-specific setup and known differences.

## Requirements

- **macOS 12 (Monterey)** or later recommended
- **Python 3.11+** (via Homebrew or python.org)
- **Apple Silicon / M1+**: use an `arm64` Python interpreter if you want a native Apple Silicon app bundle
- **Intel Macs**: use an `x86_64` Python interpreter if you want a native Intel app bundle
- **Accessibility permission** — required for CGEventTap to intercept mouse events

### Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On macOS, this will also install:
- `pyobjc-framework-Quartz` — for CGEventTap (mouse hooking) and CGEvent (key simulation)
- `pyobjc-framework-Cocoa` — for NSWorkspace (app detection) and NSEvent (media keys)

## Granting Accessibility Permission

MousePro uses a **CGEventTap** to intercept and suppress mouse button events. macOS requires Accessibility permission for this:

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**
2. Click the **+** button
3. Add either:
  - **Terminal.app** / **iTerm2** (if running from terminal)
  - The Python binary (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/python3`)
  - The built `.app` bundle (if packaged)
4. Ensure the checkbox is **enabled**
5. Restart MousePro if it was already running

If Accessibility is not granted, MousePro will print:
```
[MouseHook] ERROR: Failed to create CGEventTap!
```

## Platform Differences

| Feature | Windows | macOS |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Mouse hook | SetWindowsHookExW (LL hook) | CGEventTap |
| Key simulation | SendInput (VK codes) | CGEvent (CGKeyCodes) |
| Media keys | VK_MEDIA_* constants | NSEvent (NX key IDs) |
| App detection | GetForegroundWindow | NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication |
| Gesture button | HID++ + Raw Input fallback | HID++ + event-tap movement |
| Scroll inversion | Coalesced SendInput | CGEventCreateScrollWheelEvent |
| Modifier key | Ctrl | Cmd (⌘) |
| Config location | `%APPDATA%\\MousePro` | `~/Library/Application Support/MousePro` |
| Auto-reconnect | Device change notification | HID++ reconnect loop |

### Key Mapping Differences

Actions that use **Ctrl** on Windows automatically use **Cmd (⌘)** on macOS:
- Copy → Cmd+C
- Paste → Cmd+V
- Cut → Cmd+X
- Undo → Cmd+Z
- etc.

Desktop/navigation actions are also remapped to native macOS behavior:
- **Alt+Tab** becomes **Cmd+Tab**
- Compatibility entries like **Win+D** / **Task View** resolve to native macOS navigation shortcuts
- MousePro also exposes macOS-specific actions such as **Mission Control**, **App Expose**, **Previous Desktop**, **Next Desktop**, **Show Desktop**, and **Launchpad**

### HID Access

On macOS, the HID gesture listener uses non-exclusive access (`hid_darwin_set_open_exclusive(0)`)
so the mouse continues to function normally while MousePro reads HID++ reports.

### Trackpad and Magic Mouse Scroll

MousePro ignores trackpad and Magic Mouse continuous scroll events by default so two-finger gestures and macOS natural scrolling keep working normally while mouse wheel mappings stay active.

You can change this in **Point & Scroll → Scroll Direction → Ignore trackpad**. Leave it enabled for built-in trackpads and most Logitech mouse setups. Disable it only if you intentionally want MousePro to handle Magic Mouse or trackpad scroll events.

## Building a Native macOS App

The repository now includes a dedicated macOS bundle flow:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt pyinstaller
./build_macos_app.sh
```

This produces:

```text
dist/MousePro.app
```

Notes:

- Build on the target architecture. On an M1/M2/M3 Mac, use an `arm64` Python to produce an Apple Silicon app; on an Intel Mac, use an `x86_64` Python to produce an Intel app.
- You can also set `PYINSTALLER_TARGET_ARCH=arm64` or `PYINSTALLER_TARGET_ARCH=x86_64` before running `./build_macos_app.sh` when your macOS Python environment supports that target.
- The build flow uses the committed `images/AppIcon.icns` when present; otherwise the script generates an `.icns` icon from `images/logo_icon.png`, then runs PyInstaller with `MousePro-mac.spec`.
- Signing path depends on `POURINPUT_SIGN_IDENTITY`. Unset: the bundle is ad-hoc signed (`codesign --sign -`), which is fine for one-off builds but can rotate the code identity on every rebuild, so macOS Accessibility grants may reset. Set to a codesigning identity (list with `security find-identity -v -p codesigning`, SHA-1 form preferred): the script signs nested `.dylib` / `.so` / `.framework` files depth-first with `--options runtime`, then signs the outer bundle with `build_resources/MousePro.entitlements`, then runs `codesign --verify --deep --strict` and aborts the build if it fails. Stable permission behavior depends on unchanged source, resolved Python interpreter, dependencies, architecture, signing identity, entitlements, and timestamp policy.
- This signed path is for local repeated developer builds. It is not a notarized release-signing workflow; public macOS release zips remain ad-hoc signed until a separate Developer ID signing, secure timestamp, notarization, stapling, and Gatekeeper assessment workflow exists.
- The app can then be moved to `/Applications/MousePro.app` and launched directly from Finder, Spotlight, or Dock.
- `pyinstaller MousePro.spec` remains available as a simpler cross-platform build path, but the dedicated macOS script is the preferred bundle flow.
- Release builds publish `MousePro-macOS.zip` for Apple Silicon and `MousePro-macOS-intel.zip` for Intel Macs.

The packaged app runs as an `LSUIElement`, so it lives in the menu bar instead of showing a Dock icon.

## Running

```bash
python main_qml.py
python main_qml.py --start-hidden
```

Use `--start-hidden` to launch straight into the menu bar without opening the settings window.

## Start at Login

MousePro can manage **Start at login** from the app UI on macOS.

- The toggle writes a LaunchAgent plist to `~/Library/LaunchAgents/io.github.szboboxing.mousepro.plist`
- The setting is designed for the packaged `.app`, but it also works in a source checkout by launching the current Python interpreter directly
- If **Start minimized** is enabled in MousePro, the app still launches tray-first after login because that preference is read from config at startup
- Turning **Start at login** back off removes that LaunchAgent plist again

## Accessibility for the Packaged App

If you switch from Terminal-based startup to `MousePro.app`, re-grant Accessibility for the app bundle:

1. Open **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility**
2. Remove old Terminal / Python entries if needed
3. Add **MousePro.app**
4. Ensure it is enabled
5. Restart MousePro

## Debugging

Send SIGUSR1 to dump all thread stack traces:
```bash
kill -USR1 $(pgrep -f main_qml.py)
```
